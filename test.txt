Replace
If I were to replace ' ' with '!', what would the string/"Fallout!76 is!a**GOOD GAME** "/

"Fallout 76 is a**GOOD GAME** " 
"Fallout-76-is-a**GOOD-GAME**-"
"Fallout!76!is!a**GOOD!GAME**!"

The answer is 4. Each of the spaces were replaced by an exclamation point. The code is: .replace(" ","!")/

print(s.join(test)) / ? /
Python, Java, Ruby, ->->
Python->->Java->->Ruby

->->, Python, Ruby, Java
None of the above.

The answer is 2. .join() takes objects and returns them one at a time. In this case, the elements of test are being joined by 's.'
